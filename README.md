- Model quantities such that you can represent
  - weights like 10 gram, 10 kilogram
  - lengths 2 yard, 3 feet
  - temperatures 10 celsius, 23 fahrenheit etc
- Implement equality such that
  - 2 feet == 24 inch
  - 2 feet != 24 gram
- Implement conversions such that
  - 2 feet in inch gives 24 inch
  - 2 feet in gram gives compile error
- Implement addition only for scaled quantities like length and weight (but not temperature) such that
  - 2 feet + 3 feet == 5 feet
  - 2 feet + 12 inch == 3 feet
  - 2 feet + 10 gram gives compile error
- Ensure that you can chain additions without casting, like
  - 2 feet + 12 inch + 1 feet == 4 feet
- Ensure that your solution is DRY
  - implement exactly one method for equality, conversion, addition across quantities
